This is a prototype of multiscale application skeleton framework.
Its experimental and will not be working now !

The framework generates Muscle (http://muscle.berlios.de) project from specyfication in MASK DSL 
(see examples/model1.mask) 

Quick start:

1. generate muscle java sources from your specyfication in mask language
- for example for  model1.mask

ruby src/mask.rb examples/model1.mask

2. generate jar (you have to have muscle installed and set up env $MUSCLE_HOME)

cd generatedExamples/maskExample1/
ant

3. run using MUSCLE

muscle.rb --main plumber modA modB --cxa_file cxa/maskExample1.cxa.rb 

if there is a memory problem it is good to set heap range for muscle with additional option:
--heap "128m..216m"

4.You can run it in GridSpace on ui (https://gs2.mapper-project.eu/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/) with Muscle interpreter 
using cxa contents in snippet (change classpath in CxA to the absolute path).

For running it in the GS on ui you may have to manually install ruby gem json
